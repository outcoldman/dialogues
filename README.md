## Project Dialogues

Do you like [Disqus](http://disqus.com/)? I do. It gives you very simple way to add support of commentaries on your website or blog. But it is too restricted, it does not allow you to change it in a way as you want it (I want to use [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)!). So this is why I decided to create project Dialogues. 

Project is still under development.
