# Project Dialogues

Hi there, I'm Den ([outcoldman](http://outcoldman.com)) and this is project Dialogues. Do you like [Disqus](http://disqus.com/)? I do. It gives you very simple way to add support of commentaries on your website or blog. But it is too restricted, it does not allow you to change it in a way as you want it (for example use [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)). So this is why I decided to create project Dialogues. 

So, what is the Project Dialogues? This is how I see it:

1. Node.js server for handling commentaries.
2. Client library for communicating with server and rendering commentaries.
3. Management system for Dialogues.
4. Project Dialogues can be service in cloud for everybody (especially if I will get one of the prizes - I think this will be a good way for using free cloud services). 

I do not have plans to build parts 3 and 4 in time of [Node.js Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com/) hackathon. But a lot of features for 1 and 2 already implemented.

* Server can be configured to support different storages: mongodb, files and in-memory storages are implemented.
